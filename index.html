        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Jace Hansen and I am a jack of all trades, master of none.  
          I enjoy trying new things, and making new friends.  
          I have spent most of my life in Springville, Utah where I learned many valuable life lessons.
          I come from a family of six.  My dad and mom, two older sisters and a younger brother.  
          My parents have set a great example to me of how to have a Christ centered home while 
          also navigating the rapids of life.  I served a COVID mission in Santa Fe Argentina and Anaheim California.  
          Those two years are a staple to the way I live my life.  
        <p>
          I am a fun and optimistic person and my favorite 
          act of service is being able to brighten someoneâ€™s day. A few of my favorite hobbies include watching and 
          playing sports, coding on my computer, and spending time with my family.  
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am marrying the love of my life, 
          Addison Nielson, on April 26, 2023.
