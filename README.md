During the Simon activity, I learned a lot about how to add on to my website.  It was really tricky for me to clone a new repository and get it to work.  It is important that the caddy file looks the way it should.  It is also really important that all of the simon files get set up or it wont run the way it should.  The deployFiles also needs to be an executable.

From the Simon CSS activity, I learned how much CSS can add to the appearance of a website.  It is important that I set the sizes of the windows correctly or it will look wanky.

After adding HTML and CSS to my startup project, I learned a lot about how to apply what I've learned to real life websites.  It is a lot more difficult to format in CSS than I thought it would be.

After adding JS to the Simon page, I learned a lot about the importance of formatting the page correctly.  JS has a very particular way that it likes code written in.  It will take me some time to get used to but once you know the correct format, getting the code to output what you want becomes a lot easier.

From the Service Simon project, I learned how to use node.js to host front-end project files.  There were many new codes that I am learning for this new portion of the project which is tough for me to wrap my head around but it seems like after
adding the front end service, it helps out significantly with login information and score keeping.

From the Simon DB project, I learned the importance of using a program like mongodb to tie my program's information down.  It is a quick and easy way to protect info.

From the Simon Login project, I learned secureApiRouter verifies credentials for endpoints. GetUser verifies credentials for the user. 

From the Simon Websocket project, I learned that it is a lot more simple to have a peer chat than I had initially thought.  After starting up the connection, pretty much all that's left to do is push messages out.
